    "  * __[ ]__ blank indicates that the cell has not yet been executed.\n",
    "  * __[\\*]__ indicates that the cell is currently executing.\n",
    "  * Once a cell is done executing, a number will appear in the small brackets with each cell execution to indicate where in the sequence the cell has been executed. Any output (e.g. print()'s) from the code will appear below the cell."
